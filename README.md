# Hospital Chatbot Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a hospital chatbot to provide first-class assistance during peak hours of the hospital. The chatbot will interact with users, responding to their queries and providing relevant information.

## Project Description

As a Data Scientist, the goal is to build an interactive chatbot for a renowned hospital. The project will utilize a dataset containing queries and corresponding responses. The dataset will be processed and used to train a Deep Learning model capable of generating responses to user queries. The chatbot aims to assist the hospital's customer care department efficiently during busy hours.

## Key Objectives

1. **Dataset Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the given dataset containing {Queries/Responses}.
